# A-Star-Path-Planning

This project implements the **A\* (A-Star) path planning algorithm** for navigating a grid-based map.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Grid-based path planning with 4-directional movement
- Obstacle avoidance (cells with value `0` are impassable)
- Euclidean distance heuristic for optimal path estimation
- Returns the shortest path from a start to an end point, if one exists
